# The 937B appears to have preamble on all commands and responses
# of the form '@<aaa>', where aaa is the unit number (1-254)
# presumably to cater for multidrop RS485 for multiple controllers.
# Default here to assume just one unit (as on RS232). Will need to make this variable if RS485 is ever implemented.

# Send an initial dummy command to clear out any garbage the mks has already received.
# This makes it more likely that the first command sent is received OK.
# NB we dont wait for a response to the dummy command because if it didnt arrive (e.g. rs232 unplugged) then
# streams would issue a replyTimeout exception and stop the ioc.

# Use a regular expression to not care about anything before ACK.
# This is important with the MKS firmware update in Feb 2012, where '@' will precede all responses,
# but we still need backward compatibility with units which do not emit '@'.
